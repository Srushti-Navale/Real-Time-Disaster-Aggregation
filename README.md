*Project Abstract: Real-Time Disaster Alert Dashboard*

In a crisis, every second counts. Our *Real-Time Disaster Alert Dashboard* delivers live updates by scraping *breaking news* (BBC, Reddit) and social feeds—no APIs needed! Built with *Python* and *Streamlit*, the system extracts disaster reports, filters critical updates, and displays them in a clean, interactive dashboard.

The dashboard utilizes *web scraping* to pull the latest disaster headlines from BBC News and Reddit forums. *Instant visualization* is achieved through Streamlit, rendering updates in real-time with clickable links for deeper insights. Additionally, the dashboard is *community-powered*, aggregating crowd-sourced alerts from forums like Reddit's r/disasters.

*Key features* of the dashboard include:

- *No API dependencies*: Uses BeautifulSoup to scrape public sources directly.
- *Lightweight and fast*: Pandas cleans data, while Streamlit makes it shareable in seconds.
- *User-friendly*: Perfect for journalists, responders, or concerned citizens.

By bypassing complex APIs, this tool democratizes disaster intelligence—proving you don’t need expensive infrastructure to build life-saving tech. *Stay informed. React faster.*
